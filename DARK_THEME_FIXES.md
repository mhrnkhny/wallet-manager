## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Contrast Ratios
- All text meets WCAG AA standards (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)
- Important UI elements maintain 3:1 contrast minimum
- Interactive elements have clear hover/focus states

### 2. Consistency
- All components use `rounded-2xl` or `rounded-3xl` for corners
- Border opacity consistently uses `/30` for subtle borders
- Background transparency uses `/20` for hover states
- Text hierarchy: white → gray-300 → gray-400 → gray-500

### 3. Visual Feedback
- Hover states change background with 20% opacity overlays
- Active states increase to 30% opacity
- Focus rings use 20% opacity of primary color
- Transitions are smooth (200ms duration)

### 4. Accessibility
- Focus rings are clearly visible with proper offset
- Color isn't the only indicator (text, icons, borders also used)
- Disabled states maintain readability with 50% opacity
- Loading states provide clear visual feedback
